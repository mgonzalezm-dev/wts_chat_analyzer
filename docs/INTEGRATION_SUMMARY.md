### Frontend (React/TypeScript)
- **Framework**: React 19 with TypeScript
- **State Management**: Redux Toolkit
- **UI Components**: Material-UI (MUI)
- **Data Visualization**: Recharts
- **Real-time**: WebSocket client for live updates
- **Testing**: Vitest for unit tests, Cypress for E2E

### Infrastructure
- **Containerization**: Docker and Docker Compose
- **Orchestration**: Kubernetes with Helm charts
- **Reverse Proxy**: Nginx with WebSocket support
- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions workflows

## Deployment Configuration

### Docker Compose
```yaml
services:
  backend:
    build: ./backend
    environment:
      - DATABASE_URL=postgresql://user:pass@postgres:5432/db
      - REDIS_URL=redis://redis:6379
    depends_on:
      - postgres
      - redis

  frontend:
    build: ./frontend
    environment:
      - VITE_API_URL=http://backend:8000

  nginx:
    image: nginx:alpine
    volumes:
      - ./docker/nginx/default.conf:/etc/nginx/conf.d/default.conf
    ports:
      - "80:80"
```

### Kubernetes

## Known Issues and Future Improvements

### Current Limitations
1. File size limit of 500MB (can be increased)
2. English-only NLP models (can add multilingual support)
3. Basic export templates (can be enhanced)
4. Limited real-time collaboration features

### Recommended Improvements
1. Add support for more messaging platforms
2. Implement advanced analytics (ML-based insights)
3. Add collaborative features (sharing, comments)
4. Enhance export templates with branding options
5. Implement data retention policies
6. Add more comprehensive audit logging
